I started by reading the course description carefully and outlining how I would approach the tasks throughout the course. 
Since I already had some experience with Android Studio, I decided to use this opportunity to improve my project organization and UI design skills.
I planned to organize all my exercises in a single GitHub repository for clarity and structure.

I briefly watched the intro video, skipping the parts about installing Android Studio as I already had it set up. 
I created a new GitHub repository dedicated to the coursework and prepared the folder structure for uploading each exercise clearly.

I followed the first video tutorial to build a basic calculator app that adds two numbers together. 
This helped refresh my knowledge of using EditText, Button, and TextView, and how to implement button click events in Java.
It was a great way to re-familiarize myself with Android layout handling and Java logic. I committed the work under the Exercise folder.

I moved on to the Core Elements part 2 tutorial, which focused on Intent usage and navigating between activities.
Although I had done this before, it was useful to practice passing data with putExtra, and using Intent.ACTION_VIEW to open a browser via a button press. 
Everything worked smoothly after testing, and I committed the finished app under the Exercise2 folder.

I completed Exercise 3 by following the Lists, Layouts, and Images tutorial.
I decided to build a small fruit information app that displays a list of three fruits: passionfruit, guava, and banana.
I used RecyclerView to list the fruit names, and when the user taps a fruit,
a new activity opens showing an image of the selected fruit along with a short fact or description about it.

For the course project, I built a Workout Tracker app. The idea was to create a simple tool where users can log workouts by choosing the date, type of workout, duration, and comments
. I wanted to apply what I learned in Android development while making something personally useful.

I implemented a clean UI with input fields and a date picker. Saved workouts appear in a RecyclerView on the main screen.
I also added a summary view that shows total workouts, duration, and the latest session. After testing and improving the 
layout, I pushed the project into the Project folder in my course GitHub repository.
